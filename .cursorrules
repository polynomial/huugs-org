# Cursor Rules for Photo Gallery Project

## General Behavior
- Always automatically take steps to solve the problem without waiting for permission

- Test your changes thoroughly before considering a task complete
- Re-validate and verify functionality before saying you are done
- If something doesn't work, investigate further and try alternative approaches
- Always follow through on fixes and improvements

## Problem Solving Approach
- When encountering errors, immediately diagnose and attempt to fix them
- Use multiple validation methods (visual inspection, testing, HTTP requests)
